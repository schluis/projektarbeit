   abstract = {Abstract It has been speculated that by the year 2050, technology will have progressed to the point of complete autonomy. This paper scrolls through patent pathways and intellectual developments throughout the industrial revolutions listing significant products and services that landmarked each revolution up to Industry 4.0. The patent trails and the recent IPR inputs are expected to assist readers in fast-tracking up to speed on the bleeding edge of the current research pools while having an eagle's eye perspective on the previous developments so far. The research pools of Industry 4.0 are classified and explored. A lack of Human-machine workforce synergy in Industry 4.0 and the nascent “customized manufacturing” concept is addressed in subsequent sections. The paper classifies two expected phases of Industry 5.0, highlighting the subdomains touted to be its focal areas. Lastly, Industry 5.0's niche research areas are checked and a suitable pathway to achieve the goals set for the sixth revolution is proposed.},

   title = {Do educational robotics competitions impact students’ learning?},
   journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
   abstract = {The development of robot technology has grown rapidly. Robots have been widely used in various aspects to help human’s interests. In the education sector, robots have also been used as a learning tool to assist in studying fields such as science and technology. Currently, to encourage the development of robots in the education sector, robot competitions are held with various kinds of events. The types of robots developed to participate in robot competitions are also varied, such as mobile robot contest, modular robot contest, humanoid robot contest, flying robot contest, underwater robot contest, innovation robot contest, brick robot contest, and VR robot contest. The robot competition events are held nationally and internationally. The purposes of this study were to identify what kind of skills obtained by students after following the learning process using educational robotics competitions and to determine the appropriate learning model for the use of educational robotics competitions in studying the field of science and technology. This research was a literature review research. The research method was the Comprehensive Literature Review (CLR). This method has three phases such as 1) exploring phase, 2) interpretation phase, and 3) communication phase. The results showed that the learning model that was widely used in educational robotics competitions was project-based learning and was followed by problem-based learning. The skills obtained were to assist understanding science and technology, to develop computer programming skills, to sharpen problem-solving capability, to foster creativity and innovation, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and to practice teamwork and social skills.}

   abstract = {Computer simulation of robot performance is an essential tool for the development of robot software. In order for simulation results to be valid for implementation on real hardware, the accuracy of the simulation model must be verified. If developers use a robot model that is not similar enough to the actual robot, then their results can be meaningless. To ensure the validity of the robot models, NIST proposes standardized test methods that can be easily replicated in both computer simulation and physical form. The actual robot can be tested, and the computer model can be finely tuned to replicate similar performances on equivalent tests. To illustrate this, we have accomplished this task with the Talon Robot on NIST standard test methods.},
